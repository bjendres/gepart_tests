
Feature: view the list of pending, future, and past assemblies.

  Background: I am logged in



  Scenario Outline: Buttons in assembly history view according to role
    Given I have the roles <Role1> and <Role2>
      And the newest assembly has assemblyphase <assemblyphase1>
      And the (newest assembly -1) has assemblyphase <assemblyphase2>
      And the CallerRoleName of the pending assembly is <callerRoleName>
    When I attempt to view the assembly history
    Then I see the assembly history 
      and the buttons "Protokoll" for all past assemblies
      and the buttons <button1> and <button2>
      and the result is <Result>
    Examples:
      | Role1     | Role2    |assemblyphase1|assemblyphase2|callerRoleName|button1            | button2             | Result |

# attention: difficult TCs because CallerRoleName sometimes belongs to newest assembly and sometimes to newest-1
