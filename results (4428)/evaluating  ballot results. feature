Feature: find the elected proposals

  Background: the assembly is past VotingEnd and before physical assembly

# per ballot: 
#     is there exactly 1 proposal nobody has severe resistance against? if yes, it is elected by Konsent
#     is there > 1 proposal nobody has severe resistance against? calculate resistance sum for these proposals, lowest sum wins by Konsent
#     is there < 1 proposal nobody has severe resistance against? calculate resistance sum for all proposals, lowest sum wins


  Scenario: one proposal without severe resistance

    Given a ballot with several proposals      
    When there is exactly 1 proposal nobody has severe resistance against
    Then this proposal is elected by Konsent
      And it is displayed with a badge Konsent

  Scenario: several proposals without severe resistance

    Given a ballot with several proposals      
    When there are more than 1 proposals nobody has severe resistance against
    Then the resistance sum for these  proposals is calculated
      And the proposal with the lowest sum is elected by Konsent
      And it is displayed with a badge Konsent

  Scenario: all proposals meet severe resistance

    Given a ballot with several proposals      
    When there is no proposal nobody has severe resistance against
    Then the resistance sum for all proposals is calculated
      And the proposal with the lowest sum is elected by resistance measurement
