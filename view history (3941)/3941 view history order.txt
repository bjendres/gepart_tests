  Scenario Outline: View assembly history in correct order
    Given the newest assembly has assemblyphase <assemblyphase1>
      And the (newest assembly -1) has assemblyphase <assemblyphase2>
    When I attempt to view the  assembly history
    Then I see the assembly history in the order of the newest assembly in
      <position1> and the next youngest (=newest assembly -1) assembly in <position2>, 
      the rest following by descending assembly id. 
  	
    Examples:
      |	assemblyphase1 | assemblyphase2 | position1 | position2 |
      | past           | past           | first     | second    |  positions would be okay, but the situation will not occur
      | future         | pending        | second    | first     |
      | pending        | past           | first     | second    |
      | future         | past           | first     | second    |
      | pending        | future         |           |           |Error: wrong order of assemblyIDs
