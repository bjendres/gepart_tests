
Feature: view the list of pending, future, and past assemblies.

  Background: I am logged in

  Scenario Outline: View assembly history in correct order
    Given the newest assembly has assemblyphase <assemblyphase1>
      And the (newest assembly -1) has assemblyphase <assemblyphase2>
    When I attempt to view the  assembly history
    Then I see the assembly history in the order of the newest assembly in
      <position1> and the next youngest (=newest assembly -1) assembly in <position2>, 
      the rest following by descending assembly id. 
  	
    Examples:
      |	assemblyphase1 | assemblyphase2 | position1 | position2 |
      | past           | past           | first     | second    |
      | future         | pending        | second    | first     |
      | pending        | past           | first     | second    |
      | future         | past           | first     | second    |
      | pending        | future         |           |           |Error: wrong order of assemblyIDs

# can there be only past assemblies? There should always be a pending/future assembly


  Scenario Outline: Buttons in assembly history view according to role
    Given I have the roles <Role1> and <Role2>
      And the newest assembly has assemblyphase <assemblyphase1>
      And the (newest assembly -1) has assemblyphase <assemblyphase2>
      And the CallerRoleName of the pending assembly is <callerRoleName>
    When I attempt to view the assembly history
    Then I see the assembly history 
      and the buttons "Protokoll" for all past assemblies
      and the buttons <button1> and <button2>
      and the result is <Result>
    Examples:
      | Role1     | Role2    |assemblyphase1|assemblyphase2|callerRoleName|button1            | button2             | Result |

# is it allowed to change a call for an assembly between physical assembly and the adding of the proceedings? Is this checked somewhere?
# attention: difficult TCs because CallerRoleName sometimes belongs to newest assembly and sometimes to newest-1
